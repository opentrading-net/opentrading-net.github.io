Tesseract is a radical approach to building business applications. It's a platform to support modular applications where the focus in on business logic to providing solutions for business; to short cut the development cycle; and avoid changing technologies being more of a hindrance than a help.

The idea for Tesseract came out of experiences building a global metals, coal & concentrates solution for a mining comglomerate. After 15+ years of experience of configuring, extending and integrating CTRM solutions we had an epiphany with [Aspect] that we could finally give the Business exactly what they wanted for each of their business units (or at least pretty close).

## Aspect

Aspect is a basic CTRM that has some innovative features; in particular: a in-memory model; real time risk and a built-in scripting language designed primarily for reporting and interface definitions. In the early days the scripting features were basic (e.g. no functions!) but even in its limited form it allowed for the data model to be extended. Over time as the programme of work progressed we worked with the vendor to improve the scripting features and effectively built a custom CTRM on top of the out-of-the-box product.

## Tesseract

Tesseract takes the concept of a scriptable, extensible data model and builds a system based on this idea from the ground up. It uses modern, off-the-shelf technolgies (e.g. C#, [Roslyn], [DevExtreme Widgets], [SQL Server], [Azure DevOps]) to build a light weight application landscape that can allows technical BAs and developers to quickly build useful, performant applications.

## Zen and the Art of Application Development

1. Extensible data model
2. Consistently generated User Interface
3. No impedence mis-match in the data model
4. Sessions - source control for business data
5. Integration as a declaration
6. Modular approach
7. Lightweight landscape
8. DevOps support
