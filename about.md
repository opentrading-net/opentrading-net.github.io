I've worked in the IT industry since leaving University in the early 1990s. I worked for 6 years at IBM at their Hursley Research and Development Lab. I was doing low-level work: initially microcode for point of sale terminals and later real-time Unix and embedded drivers to control the electricity network of South Wales. I left to become a contractor and moved into the financial industry. This was mostly technical/architecture work until I was hired as the team lead for Barcap to integrate a new global oil trading platform into their existing landscape. To say this was a baptism of fire is an understatement; I knew nothing of commodities trading and less about the selected platform, [RightAngle]. But I did a good job and realised how much more interesting this business was then just the technology behind IT systems. For the next 15 years I built CTRM trading platforms round Europe with [RightAngle], [Endur], [CXL], [Aspect] enhancing them with custom front ends, planning tools, dash boards, etc. and integrating them into Risk, Finance, Tax reporting adn invoicing and scheduling systems.

I now run [Open Trading Network] with my business partner, Craig, and look forward to delivering more solutions to clients in the industry as their Business continues to evolve.

Since 2006 I've been working in the commodities industry, initially as a member of the risk team for a large oil company on the crude oil trading desk where I cut my teeth in the understanding of the physical oil market and related derivative trades. 
I have since performed many project roles across Europe at various commodities companies, including integrated oli, utilities, traders and investment banks. On this journey I have been lucky enough to cover many commodities markets both physical and financial including, oil, refined products, LPG, coal, freight, gas, power and metals. I have carried out sucessful IT delivery roles in business analysis, project management, optimisation and business change with a regular focus on middle & front office risk areas (Position, P&L, Exposure, Valuation, VAR & Scheduling/Logistics).
Over the years I have obtained extensive experience implementing the CTRM solutions [Endur], [RightAngle], [Aspect] & custom IT solutions. 

I am now excited to be running [Open Trading Network] with my business partner, David. We thrive on the delivery of solutions to complex problems for the benefit of our clients across the commodities industry in a pragmatic and down-to-earth way.
