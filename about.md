I've worked in the IT industry since leaving University in the early 1990s. I worked for 6 years at IBM at their Hursley Research and Development Lab. I was doing low-level work: initially microcode for point of sale terminals and later real-time Unix and embedded drivers to control the electricity network of South Wales. I left to become a contractor and moved into the financial industry. This was mostly technical/architecture work until I was hired as the team lead for Barcap to integrate a new global oil trading platform into their existing landscape. To say this was a baptism of fire is an understatement; I knew nothing of commodities trading and less about the selected platform, [RightAngle]. But I did a good job and realised how much more interesting this business was then just the technology behind IT systems. For the next 15 years I built CTRM trading platforms round Europe with [RightAngle], [Endur], [CXL], [Aspect] enhancing them with custom front ends, planning tools, dash boards, etc. and integrating them into Risk, Finance, Tax reporting adn invoicing and scheduling systems.

I now run [Open Trading Network] with my partner, Craig, and look forward to delivering more solutions in the industry as the business continues to evolve
