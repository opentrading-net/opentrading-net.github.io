I have spent the last 30 years delivering projects in the energy and commodities sector ranging from power station finance, implementing central market power systems, global change and solution architecture for one of the worldâ€™s biggest oil and gas traders, investment banking, commodity software development, and more recently a green field trading and risk management platform for a leading global mining company.  I love the challenge of delivering value through the interaction of business and IT and the many facets of a business that spans mines, wells and power stations to end use customers 

In joining OTN, I am working with three diverse but like-minded individuals and I am confident that with my partners David, Clare and Craig that OTN is well placed to offer high value, pragmatic, delivery of IT and change across the energy and commodities complex to a wide range of companies and institutions.

Since 2006 I've been working in the commodities industry, initially in the risk department for a large oil company on the crude oil trading desk where I cut my teeth in the understanding of the physical oil market and related derivative trades. 
I have since performed many project roles across Europe at various commodities companies including, integrated oil, utilities, traders and investment banks. On this journey I have been lucky enough to cover multiple commodities markets for both physical and financial business including, oil, refined products, LPG, coal, freight, gas, power and metals. I have carried out successful IT delivery roles in business analysis, project management, optimisation and business change with a regular focus on middle & front office risk areas including position, P&L, exposure, pricing/valuation and VAR.
Over the years I have obtained extensive experience implementing the CTRM solutions [Endur], [RightAngle], [Aspect] & custom IT solutions. 

I am now excited to be running [Open Trading Network] with my partners: David; Clare and Will. We thrive on the delivery of solutions to complex problems for our clients across the commodities industry in a pragmatic and down-to-earth way.

I've worked in the IT industry since leaving University in the early 1990s. I worked for 6 years at IBM at their Hursley Research and Development Lab. I was doing low-level work: initially microcode for point of sale terminals and later real-time Unix and embedded drivers to control the electricity network of South Wales. I left to become a contractor and moved into the financial industry. This was mostly technical/architecture work until I was hired as the team lead for Barcap to integrate a new global oil trading platform into their existing landscape. To say this was a baptism of fire is an understatement; I knew nothing of commodities trading and less about the selected platform, [RightAngle]. But I did a good job and realised how much more interesting this business was then just the technology behind IT systems. For the next 15 years I built CTRM trading platforms round Europe with [RightAngle], [Endur], [CXL], [Aspect] enhancing them with custom front ends, planning tools, dash boards, etc. and integrating them into Risk, Finance, Tax reporting and invoicing and scheduling systems.

I now run [Open Trading Network] with my partners: Craig, Clare and Will; and look forward to delivering more solutions to clients in the industry as their Business continues to evolve.
