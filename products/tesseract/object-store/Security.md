# Object Store Security

The **object cache** implements access control policies to the all the data in the **object store**. The only way to access data is via the **object cache** and it will enforce Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) access to all objects using an Attribute Based Access Control ([ABAC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/abac/)) scheme.

ABAC is the successor to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and gives a much more flexible security model. RBAC can be implemented in ABAC by adding role properties to subject and object in the model.
